# Build a Simple Book Catalog Backend Application using Node-Express, Mongodb & Mongoose and Typescript (Backend Category)
** Filter Implementation

In this project, students have the option to implement the filter functionality both on the frontend side or on the backend side. But 
- if you are planning to pursue your career as a full-stack developer, you are strongly recommended to implement backend filtering. 
- If you are planning to pursue your career as a frontend developer only you can skip backend complexity. There is no requirement for implementing backend filtering. The backend does not need to support specific filtering endpoints or functionalities. 

** User Authentication and Book Management

In this project, user authentication is required. Only authenticated users should be able to edit or delete the books they have added to the catalog. Please ensure that your backend implementation includes user authentication and restricts book management operations to the authenticated user's own books. Keep in mind that unauthorized users should not have access to edit or delete books added by other users.
- if you are planning to pursue your career as a full-stack developer, you are encouraged to implement a custom authentication system. 
- If you are planning to pursue your career as a frontend developer only you can skip/implement custom authentication. If you want to skip custom authentication, you can use Firebase too There is no requirement for implementing a backend filtering. The backend does not need to support specific filtering endpoints or functionalities.


** Backend Implementation Guidelines

In order to ensure a fully functional frontend application, it is required for students to implement a backend for this project. The backend will be responsible for providing the necessary APIs to serve data to the front end and handle logic.

However, please note that the backend code will not be provided as part of this project. Students are encouraged to implement the backend independently.

The primary focus and evaluation of this project will be on the frontend implementation, specifically utilizing React, Redux Toolkit, and RTK Query. It is crucial that the front end is working properly and demonstrating the effective use of state management and data integration.

While the backend implementation is necessary for the project to function as intended, it will not be assessed or graded directly. The success of the project will be evaluated based on the functionality and performance of the front end, as well as the proper utilization of the Redux Toolkit and RTK Query.
